These files are what you'd need to compile a playable game for the Panic Playdate console,
but to do THAT, you'd also need to have installed the PlaydateSDK and got handy using it
to structure game projects and compile games...so, go to play.date/dev to do that. OR, you
could just look at the code and get a sense of what's going on with it, if it serves as a
sort of template instead?

But anyway, this "game" is a Philosophy Reading Group Simulator - designed just really as
a way for me to get good with Lua and work with the PlaydateSDK a bit, but there's something
sort of nicely ethnomethodological in here about the rendering of aspects of academic 
practice in 1-bit format with minimal controls and game mechanics etc...I'm not, at this
point, entirely sure what that something is, but I'll probably write something about it
at some point.

Thanks!
